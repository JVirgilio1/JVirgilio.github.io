## Professional Self Assessment

Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University I have had the opportunity to gain knowledge in many different areas of computer science. I have learned the basics of different coding languages, as well as databases and AI algorithms. Throughout this program, I was able to show my knowledge of C++, Python, Java, and database management software such as MongoDB. In the artifacts I have upgraded for this capstone, I was able to showcase my understanding of professional-quality programming. I believe I was also able to demonstrate my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. This degree has helped prepare me for collaborating in a team environment by providing me with half-finished code or code with errors, and allowing me to fix and improve the code. This is representative of a workplace, where code is rarely built by a single person. This degree has also prepared me for stakeholder communication by teaching the correct terms to use, and how to explain something technical to someone who does not have coding knowledge. As seen in my first artifact, I was able to make improvements to the data structures and algorithms by reducing load times, and improving the visual clarity of the project. I have also acquired knowledge of ciphers and encoding best practices for keeping the security of a project in mind. Overall, the computer science degree and capstone has prepared me for the workforce very well.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

#### Artifact One Narrative
   
   This artifact is a partial improvement of my Weight Tracker App made in Android studio. This is written in Java, and coded for Android 34 devices. This first milestone was the Software Design/Engineering section of the project, so I improved the overall visuals of the app by adding different colors and graphics. Originally, the application used a default white background with black text. Now, it is much more colorful, with added graphics. I also improved the UI, allowing a potential user to copy and paste text.Additionally, A password registry has been added, which will be used in the coming weeks for database connectivity. 
   Permissions were also adjusted, adding additional requests for both camera usage, and photo storage usage. This will also be used in the coming weeks for the addition of a meal tracking addition to the software. Additionally, I wrote a custom theme for the application with an appropriate color scheme. The android manifest was updated to include additional framework for SQL injection and saving. I do believe I met the course outcomes with these enhancements, as they have shown the ability to include technically sound and appropriately adapted code. 
	During this process, I learned more about permissions in android devices, and creating custom themes for applications. Additionally, I learned about the framework for database connection, and how passwords and usernames can be stored, if the correct permissions are met. 
 


## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

#### Artifact Two Narrative

   Continuing on my previous entries, This artifact is a continuation of my Weight Tracker App made in android studio. This is written in Java, and coded for Android 34 devices. The second milestone was the Algorithms and Data Structure section of the project, so I tried to improve the timeliness of the program, and fixed and improved some of the permissions and paths used. Originally, this application had a startup time of about 130 ms. This was mainly due to some cyclical and unnecessary coding, which has been trimmed and improved. One of my main objectives for this week was to add the ability to take a picture of a meal, and upload it to a meal plan. I ran into a bit of an issue with this with permissions, since many commands based around writing and reading external storage are depreciated on the API that I am working with. With that knowledge, I have started shifting the API up from 35 to 36, which is the current version. This affected some of my previous code, but nothing detrimental. This not only has solved my issue with external storage permissions, it has also helped further me towards other course outcomes. 
   Additionally, I have added two additional xml files, one of which handles the image processing and routing, and the other that handles the meal logging. The meal logging tab will also be included in the database connectivity that I will add with next weekâ€™s milestone, and preliminary SQL framework was included.


## Enhancement Three: Databases

#### Artifact Three Narrative

   Continuing on my previous entries, This artifact is a continuation of my Weight Tracker App made in android studio. This is written in Java, and coded for Android 34 devices. The third milestone was the Databases section of the project, so I created code to give the application the ability to link to a SQLight database. If active, this can store usernames and passwords, meal plans, and the weight tracker for different individuals. Almost all work was done in the DBHelper java class. This lets SQL create a table if one does not exist for a specified username, and record the target weight and all input weights. It will also return with positive or negative feedback if the weight is input into the database. I believe that my main objective this week was met, since I added the ability to connect to a database. In changing and improving this artifact, I learned more about database connectivity, and how applications can link to multiple databases.
